# Static Portfolio
# Usama Khalid | Web Development Projects

Welcome to my personal web development project! This repository showcases my responsive **portfolio** built using **HTML** and **CSS**.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: The structure of the site
- **CSS**: Styling for layout and design

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The site is fully responsive and looks great on devices of all sizes.
- **Mobile-First**: Optimized for mobile devices first, with styling adjustments for larger screens.
- **Interactive Elements**: Simple form with basic validation.

## Project Overview
This project is part of my ongoing journey as a front-end developer. Iâ€™ve built it to not only showcase my work but also to apply what I've been learning about **web development**. The portfolio will continue to evolve as I learn more about **JavaScript**, **front-end frameworks**, and **UX/UI design**.
